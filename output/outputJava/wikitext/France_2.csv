The Constitution of the Fifth Republic was approved by referendum on 28 September 1958. It greatly strengthened the authority of the executive in relation to Parliament.

thumbThe National Assembly is the lower house of the French Parliament. The bicameral legislature comprising a National Assembly (Assemblée nationale) and a Senate. The National Assembly deputies represent local constituencies and are directly elected for 5-year terms. The Assembly has the power to dismiss the government; thus the majority in the Assembly determines the choice of government. Senators are chosen by an electoral college for 6-year terms (originally 9-year terms); one half of the seats are submitted to election every 3 years.
"The Senates legislative powers are limited; in the event of disagreement between the two chambers, the National Assembly has the final say. The Government has a strong influence in shaping the agenda of Parliament."
"Until World War II, Radicals were a strong political force in France, embodied by the Socialist Party (since 1969); and the other right-wing, centred on the The Republicans (since 2015).

"===Law=== Law of France France uses a civil legal system, wherein law arises primarily from written statutes; judges are not to make law, but merely to interpret it (though the amount of judicial interpretation in certain areas makes it equivalent to Louis XIV). In agreement with the principles of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen, law should only prohibit actions detrimental to society. As Court of Cassation, wrote about the management of prisons: Freedom is the rule, and its restriction is the exception; any restriction of Freedom must be provided for by Law and must follow the principles of necessity and proportionality. That is, Law should lay out prohibitions only if they are needed, and if the inconveniences caused by this restriction do not exceed the inconveniences that the prohibition is supposed to remedy. thumbuprightalt=color drawing of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen from 1789The basic principles that the French Republic must respect are found in the 1789 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen."
"French law is divided into two principal areas: civil law and ex post facto laws are prohibited). While administrative law is often a subcategory of civil law in many countries, it is completely separated in France and each body of law is headed by a specific supreme court: ordinary courts (which handle criminal and civil litigation) are headed by the Court of Cassation and administrative courts are headed by the Council of State."
"To be applicable, every law must be officially published in the Journal officiel de la République française."
"France does not recognise public decency"" (contraires aux bonnes mœurs) or disturbing public order (trouble à lordre public) have been used to repress public expressions of homosexuality or street prostitution.

France has laws against racism and antisemitism, while the 1990 Gayssot Act prohibits Holocaust denial."
"Freedom of religion is constitutionally guaranteed by the 1789 except in Alsace-Moselle. Nonetheless, it does recognize religious associations. The Parliament has listed many religious movements as dangerous cults since 1995, and has banned wearing conspicuous religious symbols in schools since 2004. In 2010, it banned the wearing of face-covering Islamic veils in public; human rights groups such as Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch described the law as discriminatory towards Muslims. However, it is supported by most of the population."
